# cot_reports
Tools to download CFTC Commitment-of-Traders (COT) reports, insert into db tables,  and generate analytics from data

Some of these files are legacy files and need to be updated
cot_importer.py is up-to-date and should work for files already downloaded from CFTC website

Other files need to be updated to create automated downloads and inserts into database tables
